<h1>AI Vulnerability Scan Report</h1><p><strong>Target:</strong> http://testphp.vulnweb.com/</p><p><strong>Generated:</strong> 2025-04-23_00-25-52</p><hr><h2>Form: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/search.php?test=query</h2><p>Method: post</p><p>Inputs: searchFor, goButton</p><details><summary><strong>AI Output</strong></summary><pre>SQL injection payload example based on typical assumptions of the environment might be something like this, assuming `test` is used in a WHERE clause and we have some known column names:
```sql
' OR '1'='1'; DROP TABLE art; --
```
Reason for likelihood to work: The form does not utilize any input sanitization or prepared statements which leaves the application vulnerable. Inserting such SQL will potentially drop a table if successful, due to lack of proper escaping mechanisms in PHP handling untrusted inputs from forms like this one.

XSS injection payload example might look something like:
```html
<script>alert(String)</script>
```
Reason for likelihood to work: The form does not implement any output encoding or sanitization, allowing an attacker-controlled script tag that will execute when the page is rendered. This can lead to information disclosure if such payload contains malicious JavaScript code executed in the context of a logged user session (Reflected XSS).
