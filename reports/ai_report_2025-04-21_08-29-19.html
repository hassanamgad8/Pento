<h1>AI Vulnerability Scan Report</h1><p><strong>Target:</strong> http://testphp.vulnweb.com/</p><p><strong>Generated:</strong> 2025-04-21_08-29-19</p><hr><h2>Form: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/search.php?test=query</h2><p>Method: post</p><p>Inputs: searchFor, goButton</p><details><summary><strong>AI Output</strong></summary><pre>XSS: There does not appear to be an immediate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the provided form. The form uses the POST method for submitting the user input, which means any user input will not be displayed in the URL after the form is submitted. This prevents simple reflection of user input into the HTML of the page, which is a common vector for XSS attacks.

SQLi: The form appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection (SQLi) attacks. The URL contains a parameter `test` that is not being used in the form, but its presence suggests that it may be used in the server-side code to construct an SQL query. The `searchFor` parameter, which is used in the form, is likely to be included in an SQL query without proper sanitization, making the form susceptible to SQLi attacks.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could submit a specially crafted input that manipulates the SQL query being executed on the server. For example, an attacker could submit the following input:
```bash
' OR 1=1 --
```
This input would cause the SQL query to become:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE searchFor = '' OR 1=1 --'
```
This query would return all rows from the table, effectively bypassing the search functionality and allowing the attacker to extract sensitive information from the database.

It's important to note that SQL injection vulnerabilities can have serious consequences, including data theft, data modification, and system compromise. It's essential to properly sanitize and validate user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.</pre></details><hr><h3>XSS Test</h3><pre>Input Tested: searchFor
