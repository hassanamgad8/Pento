<h1>AI Vulnerability Scan Report</h1><p><strong>Target:</strong> http://testphp.vulnweb.com/</p><p><strong>Generated:</strong> 2025-04-21_07-56-15</p><hr><h2>Form: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/search.php?test=query</h2><p>Method: post</p><p>Inputs: searchFor, goButton</p><details><summary><strong>AI Output</strong></summary><pre>1. XSS payload:

In this case, since the form's method is POST, you might not directly see an XSS vulnerability in this specific form. However, if the developer doesn't handle user input correctly in the search.php file, there could still be an XSS vulnerability. Here's a payload you could try:

XSS:

`<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability!");</script>`

To test for XSS, you would need to see if the developer reflects the user input in a dangerous way, for example, in the search results page or any other page where user input is displayed without proper sanitization.

2. SQLi payload:

The given form doesn't seem to be vulnerable to SQL injection directly, as it doesn't include any user input in the SQL query. However, if the search.php file uses the test parameter in a dangerous way, it could still be vulnerable. Here's a payload you could try:

SQLi:

`' OR 1=1 -- `

To test for SQL injection, you would need to see if the developer reflects the test parameter in a dangerous way, for example, in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

Please note that these are just examples of potential vulnerabilities. It's important to verify if the actual implementation is vulnerable by testing it in a responsible and controlled manner.</pre></details><hr><h3>XSS Test</h3><pre>Input Tested: searchFor
